Ok, here is the deal bros and ladies...

1. Pack your bags and move to a good virtualenv... 
2. Download this package, extract this file and rename it to something. I am going to rename it to PROJECT_HOME and so I am going to call it that.

Good then, we have our project out in the new world, it is time to tame our little project. 

3. Go to PROJECT_HOME/oksp/settings then rename conf.sample.py to conf.py
   (windows users, if you do not see the ".py" part, just rename "conf.sample" to "conf")

4. Now open that conf file we renamed in 3. Inside it replace '<SECRET KEY>' with some super secret key of urs.
5. I am leaving the database part to you. It should be there in conf file.
6. Now in PROJECT_HOME/oksp/settings/base_settings.py (Ahm windows users, it may be base_settings) 
   add 'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware' in middleware list,i.e. in MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES

   P.S. Don't forget the comma here after the middleware

Now lets do some pips....

7.   pip install django-debug-toolbar
8.   pip install psycopg2
9.   pip install pypandoc
10.  pip install requests
11.  pip install bs4
12.  pip install Pillow


**MAKE A DIRECTORY docs in DOCUPLOAD :)
**AND INSTALL INSTALLATION.md wala apts and pips
